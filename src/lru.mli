(** Scalable LRU caches

    [Lru] provides size-bounded finite maps that remove the least-recently-used
    (LRU) bindings in order to maintain the size constraint. Two implementations
    are provided: one is {{!F}functional}, the other {{!M}imperative}.

    The {{!F}functional} map is backed by a
    {{:https://github.com/pqwy/psq}priority search queue}. Operations on
    individual elements are [O(log n)].

    The {{!M}mutable} map is backed by the standard {!Hashtbl} paired with a
    doubly-linked list. Operations on individual elements incur an [O(1)]
    overhead on top of hash table access.

    Both versions support {{!Weighted}differentially weighted} bindings, and
    have a capacity parameter that limits the combined weight of the bindings.
    To limit the maps by the number of bindings, use [let weight _ = 1].
